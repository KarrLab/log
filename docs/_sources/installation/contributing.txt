 Contributing
==============

If you would like to contribute to log, please follow these guidelines:

   - Create and develop within a feature branch. Commits to master will be rejected.
   - Thoroughly test the code. The project currently has 100% test coverage and I'd like to keep it that way :)
   - Create or update any documentation as necessary.
   - When ready to push and open a pull request, use the Makefile process push-feature.

A really contrived workflow would be like this::

   $ git checkout -b my-awesome-feature
   $ vim log/loggers.py
   $ vim tests/test_loggers.py
   $ make test
   $ vim _docs/api/loggers.rst
   $ git add .
   $ git commit
   $ make push-feature
